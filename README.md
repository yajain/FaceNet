Face Verification - "is this the claimed person?". For example, at some airports, you can pass through customs by letting a system scan your passport and then verifying that you (the person carrying the passport) are the correct person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem.


Face Recognition - "who is this person?". For example, face recognition of employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify themselves. This is a 1:K matching problem.
